        <p>Hello! My name is Saúl Abraham Arana Calderón, and I am from Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. I enjoy playing multiplayer video games because they allow me to spend time with my friends and loved ones. Some of my childhood favorites that had a big impact on me are Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2005, RollerCoaster Tycoon, and FIFA, which I used to play with my brother. I don't play as often these days, but I still enjoy League of Legends, Clash Royale, and Destiny 2 from time to time.
<br>
<br>
I am also passionate about technology in all its forms: programming, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and hardware. I have even practiced cybersecurity on Hack The Box and set up my own media server with Docker and Jellyfin, which allows me to organize and stream movies, TV shows, and music. I especially love Linux for its versatility; Arch Linux is my favorite distribution, and I have customized it with Qtile to make it minimal and efficient.
<br>
<br>
Most of what I know I have learned through tutorials and practice, and I would like to continue growing in this field. My goal is to work as a programmer, create useful applications (I have already started one for personal finance), and eventually build my own server rack with storage, VLAN, and a complete multimedia setup. For me, technology is both a passion and a tool that makes life easier and more exciting.</p>

            Quetzaltenango is a city located in the western mountainous region of Guatemala. It is set against a backdrop of several volcanoes, including the imposing Santa María volcano with its active lava dome, Santiaguito. The Holy Spirit Cathedral dominates Central America Park and has a colonial Baroque façade and a 20th-century interior. The city is known for its neoclassical buildings, including the House of Culture and the restored Municipal Theater.
